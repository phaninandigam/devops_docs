Git and Jenkins:

we have a webhook setup, but when we do a specfifc commit, the pipeline shouldn't run -- ci skip
If you push multiple commits at once, and the latest commit includes a [ci skip] or [skip ci] tag, it will skip the pipeline execution for all commits in that push. This feature is not supported for fork PRs. Scheduled workflows will run even if you push a commit with [ci skip] message.

Matrix build in getaction
-- Matrix builds are a feature of GitHub Actions that allow you to run multiple jobs in parallel across different configurations, such as operating systems, language versions, and architectures. This allows you to test various configurations easily without redundant workflows.
